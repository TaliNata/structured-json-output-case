# Evaluation

## Experimental Setup
All runs were performed using the same model and configuration.
The model was intentionally fixed to isolate the effect of prompt design.

## Observations
- JSON schema was preserved across all runs
- No extraneous text was generated
- Field names and structure remained identical
- Variability was limited to wording only

## Conclusion
The prompt successfully constrained the model to produce
stable, machine-readable JSON outputs suitable for automation.
