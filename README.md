# Structured Output (JSON) – Prompt Engineering Case

This repository demonstrates how prompt design can enforce
strictly structured JSON output from a large language model.

## Goal
Generate machine-readable, schema-compliant JSON suitable
for automated processing and logging.

## Model
- OpenAI GPT-4–class LLM
- Chat-based interaction

## What This Shows
- Control over output structure
- Reduced variability
- Automation-ready responses

## Repository Structure
- `prompt/` – system and user prompt
- `results/` – real model outputs
- `evaluation.md` – observations and conclusions
